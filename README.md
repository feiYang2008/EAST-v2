# EAST: An Efficient and Accurate Scene Text Detector

## Introduction

This is a PyTorch re-implementation of EAST: An Efficient and Accurate Scene Text Detector ([paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1704.03155)). The features are summarized blow:

- Only RBOX part is implemented.
- A fast Locality-Aware NMS in C++ provided by the paper's author.
- The pre-trained model provided achieves 80.83 F1-score on ICDAR 2015 Incidental Scene Text Detection Challenge using only training images from ICDAR 2015 and 2013. see here for the detailed results.
- Differences from original paper
    - Use ResNet-50 rather than PVANET
    - Use dice loss (optimize IoU of segmentation) rather than balanced cross entropy
    - Use linear learning rate decay rather than staged learning rate decay
